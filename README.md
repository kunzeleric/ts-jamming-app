# Jamming App TS - Build your own playlist!

This app was designed to let the user search for songs and set up a playlist.
The search is performed in a Deezer's API and it return 25 songs according to what the user typed in the search bar.

I made this app to further develop my Typescript abilities, to practice project configuration with Styled Components by applying Global styles and Default Layout and to consume an API's data and manipulate it as I wanted it to be shown to the final user.
